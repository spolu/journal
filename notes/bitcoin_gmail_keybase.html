      <h1>Secure your Bitcoins with Gmail and Keybase</h1>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>

      <p>
      I've invested a few BTC and ETH funds over the past few months in a very
      speculative way (whether it's a smart thing to do or not is probably the
      subject of another post) and a very simple need arose: secure these
      coins out of the marketplaces where I acquired them. I'm already taking
      quite a lot of risk exposing myself to BTC or ETH so I definitly don't
      want to expose myself to the risk of default of the marketplaces I use on
      top of that.
      </p>

      <p>
      A quick search online yielded the following solutions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Setup a paper waller[0].</li>
        <li>Setup a cold-storage wallet on a USB key or SDD drive[1].</li>
        <li>Buy a hardware wallet[2].</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Not being a Bitcoin power-user but more of an occasional coin investor
      (mostly motivated by curiosity and fun-seeking), I really don't want to
      setup a paper wallet or a cold USB wallet (I know I'd just eventually
      loose them) and I'm not keen on spending money on a hardware wallet. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <i>
        I really just want to generate a wallet and store it securely on my
        GMail account so that I'm sure that I'll be able to retrieve it
        eventually, at some point.
      </i>
      </p>

      <p>
      So I opted for the following solution relying on GMail[3] and Keybase[4]
      that I find strike the right trade-off between ease of use, durability
      and security, at least for me. I'll describe that solution for Bitcoin
      but it is easily adaptable to other currencies.
      </p>

      <p>
      You'll need the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A Gmail account[3] or any other long-term email solution that
          works for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Keybase account[4] or any long-term PGP solution that works for
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          NodeJS[5] installed on your machine
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Setting up the wallet</h2>

      <p>
      Create new directory that we'll use to install a few npm (node) packages.
      Once finished you can delete that directory.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="bash hljs">
$ mkdir bitcoin_wallet
$ cd bitcoin_wallet
      </code></pre>

      <p>
      Install the library we'll need to work with Bitcoin addresses.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="bash hljs">
$ npm install --save bitcoinjs-lib
      </code></pre>

      <p>
      From there you can start the NodeJS REPL (ctrl-D to exit).
      </p>

      <pre><code class="bash hljs">
$ node
>
      </code></pre>
