      <h1>Secure your Bitcoins with Gmail and Keybase</h1>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>

      <p>
      I've invested a few BTC and ETH funds over the past few months in a very
      speculative way (whether it's a smart thing to do or not is probably the
      subject of another post) and a very simple need arose: secure these
      coins out of the marketplaces where I acquired them. I'm already taking
      quite a lot of risk exposing myself to BTC or ETH so I definitly don't
      want to expose myself to the risk of default of the marketplaces I use on
      top of that.
      </p>

      <p>
      A quick search online yielded the following solutions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Setup a paper waller[0].</li>
        <li>Setup a cold-storage wallet on a USB key or SDD drive[1].</li>
        <li>Buy a hardware wallet[2].</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Not being a Bitcoin power-user but more of an occasional coin investor
      (mostly motivated by curiosity and fun-seeking), I really don't want to
      setup a paper wallet or a cold USB wallet (I know I'd just eventually
      loose them) and I'm not keen on spending money on a hardware wallet. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <i>
        I really just want to generate a wallet and store it securely on my
        GMail account so that I'm sure that I'll be able to retrieve it
        eventually, at some point.
      </i>
      </p>

      <p>
      So I opted for the following solution relying on GMail[3] and Keybase[4]
      that I find strike the right balance between ease of use, durability
      and security, at least for me. I'll describe that solution for Bitcoin
      but it is easily adaptable to other currencies.
      </p>

      <p>
      You'll need the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A Gmail account[3] or any other long-term email solution that
          works for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Keybase account[4] or any long-term PGP solution that works for
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          NodeJS[5] installed on your machine
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Setting up the wallet</h2>

      <p>
      Create new directory that we'll use to install a few npm (node) packages.
      Once finished you can delete that directory.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="bash hljs">
$ mkdir bitcoin_wallet
$ cd bitcoin_wallet
      </code></pre>

      <p>
      Install the library we'll need to work with Bitcoin addresses.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="bash hljs">
$ npm install --save bitcoinjs-lib
      </code></pre>

      <p>
      From there you can start the NodeJS REPL (ctrl-D to exit).
      </p>

      <pre><code class="bash hljs">
$ node
>
      </code></pre>

      <p>
      We'll use BitcoinJS to generate a Bitcoin address locally. Please note
      that if your computer is compromised, this address might be intercepted
      by an attacker (I'll try to point out all the security assumptions I'm
      making along the way).
      <p>

      <pre><code class="bash hljs">
> var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')
undefined
> var keyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom()
undefined
> keyPair.toWIF()
'L5CuJMArhoEHd2aRgduovHAeCRS7WqGSjFCDyHZGrjyLPKnDL9Rf'
> keyPair.getAddress()
'1Jo7DC8bUcZcD2goCVBvBvZ4od2D1KRw8'
>
      </code></pre>

      <h2>Securing your private key</h2>

      <p>
      The string returned from the `toWIF()` call is your private key. The
      string returned by `getAddress()` is your Bitcoin address.  Copy-paste
      both of them in <a href="https://keybase.io/encrypt">keybase.io/encrypt</a>
      and add yourself as recipient. After clicking `Encrypt` you should get a
      PGP encrypted representation of your key:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="hljs">

-----END PGP MESSAGE-----

      <p>
      At this point you trust PGP with your key and the fact that your computer
      is not compromised (since the PGP encryption happened client-side with
      Keybase). You also trust Keybase to do what they say they're doing. I
      personally feel good with these assumptions given the amount of Bitcoin
      I'm trying to secure, but you might totally feel differently about it.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can store that encrypted key on your computer or, to make sure that
      you won't loose it, send it to yourself on Gmail or any other cloud email
      or storage service that you trust you will be using for a long time.
      </p>

      <p>
      <i>Out of convenience, make sure to store your Bitcoin address in clear
        along with the PGP encrypted message.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
      Gmail or anyone getting access to the PGP encrypted version of it won't
      be able to retrieve your private key.
      </p>

      <h2>Testing your setup</h2>

      <p>
      To test your setup, send a small amount of Bitcoin to your address (the
      value returned from `getAddress()` above) using your favorite wallet or
      by withdrawing a small amount from the marketplace you use.
      </p>

      <p>
      Even if transactions take a bit of time to confirm these days, it should
      instantaneously be visible as unconfirmed on blockchain.info (using the
      address we generated in this tutorial here):
      </p>

      <p>
      <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1Jo7DC8bUcZcD2goCVBvBvZ4od2D1KRw8">
        https://blockchain.info/address/1Jo7DC8bUcZcD2goCVBvBvZ4od2D1KRw8
      </a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Wait for a few hours for the transaction to confirm before proceeding to
      sending the money back to the marketplace you're using (they should allow
      deposit directly to a Bitcoin address) or your favorite wallet. Note the
      ID of the transaction (this is the longest string).
      <p>

      <p>
      <i>Make sure to send a small amount in case you are unable to use the
        Bitcoin address and private key you generated.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
      Now let's attempt to generate a reverse transaction to a Bitcoin address of your
      choice. Retrieve your encrypted blob and copy paste it at
      <a href="https://keybase.io/decrypt">keybase.io/decryot</a>. Once
      successfully decrypted, use your private key, along with the ID of your
      test transaction with the following code to generate a transaction from
      the NodeJS REPL:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="bash hljs">
> var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')
undefined
> var txID = 'b4d9aaad6ac7265db0a368c6158374a7817dc5513eeebc2e4e1ea7bf529d35c0'
undefined
> var WIF = 'L5CuJMArhoEHd2aRgduovHAeCRS7WqGSjFCDyHZGrjyLPKnDL9Rf'
undefined
> var destAddress = '1NVMjvHX6iF2xE5538GnmdxBj6gZpU8XMx'
undefined
> var amountSatoshis = 919000
undefined
> var feeSatoshis = 81000
undefined
> var keyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(WIF)
undefined
> var tx = new bitcoin.TransactionBuilder()
undefined
> tx.addInput(txID, 0)
0
> tx.addOutput(destAddress, amountSatoshis-feeSatoshis)
0
> console.log(tx.build().toHex())
      </code></pre>

      <p>
      The last value is the hex encoding of your test transaction to
      `destAddress`. You can then submit that transaction at
      <a href="https://blockchain.info/pushtx">https://blockchain.info/pushtx</a>.
      If you receive a `Transation Submitted` that means that you successfully
      manage to send bitcoins out of your wallet. You can then track the
      confirmation of the transaction on blockchain.info.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
      <i>Congrats! You now control a Bitcoin address you can safely send your funds to and
        use as a vault.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
      Obviously, you can easily extend this pattern to other cryptocurrencies
      assuming you have a way to generate new addresses, create and submit
      transactions.
